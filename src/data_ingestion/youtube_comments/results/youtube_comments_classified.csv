See the writing on the wall brother and sell the egg
"Sell the egg, keep the house, marry Sophia, and have a beautiful life!"
"Or, like so many successful entrepreneurs, keep racking your brain in search of that aha moment!  Mcdonalds and starbucks know your pain well!!"
"Housing market ALWAYS goes up.  Sell K Sig, stay in house 5 more years.  Sell house, rebuild and then lease another with the profits.  I would sell right before office changes again.  Regardless, your house would've increased significantly and the value would stabilize near the top."
1:29 why tf are they hollow?
"Sell everything, cash in. Quit youtube."
"sell the EGG , MARRY SOPHIE seriously dude💯"
992 TURBO S!!!!
Clickbait! Strad = Snitch
Male Karen
"Sells everything and marry Sofia, if you don't you need to get your head checked."
"Sell the egg, keep the house. Add some cool cars to the collection like Hellcat, mustang. Get rid of the high maintenance low fun kinda cars like the Countach"
Get a prenup if you marry Sophia I like her and I'm not saying she is after your money but she doesn't have to be to still get half of it if it doesn't work out
Maybe a gt4rs with forced induction?
buy some eggs and make flan
11:59 👍🏻
Keep the countach. It’s the coolest car you have in my opinion.
Does utah sell E85?
Rip egg 😔
Your life is falling apart. Spending money before it’s in the bank!
“Fedgrul” 😂 unlucky for the mailbox
Buy the turbo S. 991. 100% a better car for the street.
"For my fellow video editors, I coulddddd be wrong  but I think this video was edited on a timeline that is faster than the actual framerate, so the playback is eeeverr so slightly faster lol. I watch stradman so much that something was throwing me off. Nonetheless enjoyed the video"
"Definitely criminal damage to federal property! He needs his cdl taken, how many cars has he done this to? J/s"
Goodbye egg
Strads Pretty Determined to keep the Egg
"Sell Sophie, Keep the house, Marry the egg and then happy days"
Bro is going to regret selling that countach
Call the dot
It is a felony to hit a mailbox.  You should report it.  #LW4WD
992
"992 turbo s!! throw on an exhaust and its perfect, though not as flashy or loud as the gt3rs"
This is a main channel video all the way! Thanks for the content 👍
taking out any mailbox is a federal crime
992 GT3 RS
"everyone, find your own Sophia! don’t settle for anything less than what these two have"
Egg sell
this channel is falling off because of the koenigsegg
Sell the egg brother
I love how everyone has come to the conclusion the egg gotta go it’s the smart thing to do
Sell egg Strad
"Fun fact - In Canada people did NOT like these new fangled ""super mailbox"" - especially when they froze solid in freezing rain - uhoh!
I worked a part time job answering after hours calls for Canada Post at the time they started - I got the call from neighbours reporting the damage after a guy rammed his car/truck into a frozen super mailbox at -20C. Tryin to ""fix it""
""i'll escalate this to my supervisor, please stay on the line"" (In French, they were near Quebec City)) 
LOLOLOL
The story made the national news!"
"My uncle races a 1986 911 for PCA and when I go to the races and see all the different eras of 911’s, Its interesting hearing the one in this vid bc its so familiar and then I think of how everyone has experience with different cars and now they’re so used to it that hearing them isn’t the same as the first time"
Sell the egg life is good
Please just sell the dang Koenigsegg already and keep the house.
ya that trucker definitly didn't give a shit what a asshole
do the 991 not the 992 gt3 rs
WOW !  How many cups of coffee did you have before this  upload ?
SELL THE EGG!! ❌🥚
"Where did the ""e"" in federal go Stad?! Mans is saying Fedral 🤣 @13:34

Edit: added time stamp."
Great video
Shocked this wasn't sponsored by simply safe
Should've got heated driveway to get rid of the snow
Smart investors know the alt run is where fortunes are made. Alemio Network ICO is the key to capitalizing on it!
"Not financial advice, but Alemio Network is looking like one of the more legit projects I’ve seen in a while. Definitely worth checking out."
Alemio token + a Trump crypto pump = a recipe for massive gains. Don’t miss out!
The Alemio Network presale bonuses got me thinking about a long-term investment strategy. Time to dig deeper!
"BTC will go over 200k in the next year or two, that is approx 3x. Alemio can do 100x if you get positioned well. Just check it out"
"Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the following year, Alemio Network will outperform them both by far."
"If I need to choose top 3 AI coins, my picks are FET, INJ and ALM (Alemio Network), not in that particular order"
Anyone else noticing how quiet Alemio Network is flying under the radar? This is usually how the big gains sneak up on you!
"As someone who believes in the power of crypto, Alemio Network's presale has caught my attention."
"I like your picks, but these coins are already long in the market. I only invest into presales or private sales to get the best position. Alemio Network has one now, and now is the time to ape in, not one or more years later."
The ALM presale is selling fast for a reason. People are really seeing the value in this project. Can’t wait to see what’s next for Alemio Network.
Top tier presale just begun. I think Alemio Network is one of the most promissing projects year to date.
The potential of Alemio Network's AI-driven investments is worth exploring. Presale entry point
"Alemio Network is one of the rare moonshot projects out there, must check!"
"Just jumped into the Alemio token ICO. If you're serious about DeFi, this is your chance to get in early before the masses catch on."
"Presales and ICOs are the best thing in crypto, if you manage to ape in. Alemio Network is one of the prospects out there, easy 50x very soon."
I think Alemio token ALM will be one of the top performers in bullrun 2024/2025.
"The roadmap for Alemio is super ambitious. If they can deliver on even half of it, we’re in for a massive ride. ALM to the moon?"
What if I told you that Alemio Network will crush most of the top tier AI coins by the end of the year?
Rumor is that Michael Saylor invested in Alemio Network and will push this project to the moon!
"This is one-in-a-bull-run opportunity, you don´t wanna miss Alemio Network presale"
Eagerly awaiting the impact of Alemio on the crypto market. The presale is just the beginning of what promises to be a groundbreaking journey
Stradman will you please sell me your backpack 😊
"11:52 ""Thats BAD"" 👏sophie says as she eats her chikfila mac n cheese"
3:50 992 gt3rs (sell the overrated egg and work on your life)
Those are breakaway bolts..designed to break so the mailbox will fall instead of kill some one
#selltheegg
"If Sophia doesn't want to live in Utah and in that house, sell it and move to AZ and you guys get married. Then in 1-2 years build or remodel a new house down there that will be her dream house. She should be 10x more important than any car or pile of wood and bricks."
The longest beard hair ever. Absolutely incredible.
"love your vids, love the second channel, but for the love of god, please no more clickbait. thats why i QUIT cold turkey watching 717"
Marry Sophia agree 100%

"Sell everything keep the lambo for your dad and then get into tuner cars , like Randy from illuminate and Adam LZ you still get to have fun and make content, maintenance and insurance will be cheap! You know you miss the Supra and it will just be better super car are just over played you can’t build them as much unless it’s cosmetics"
"Koeninseggate 2024: sell the car, keep the house."
James lets say it together.. FED-ER-AL…  not FED-GER-AL 🤣🤣
As for simply safe with the mailboxes a total missed opportunity. 😂
"he should show Oskar more than Sophie in the videos. I was fine with her when she was in the twin turbo gallardo video as a paid actor, but now its just getting old. and to all the people saying ""marry sophia"", ""merry sophia"" etc. I dont think its in her employment contract to get married to James. it was weird to me at first that she had to keep going back and forth to canada. but then i realized its cause her husband is there, along with her 3 children, and home renovation business."
Might be time for a home update by removing all cement and reinstalled with infloor heating to stop ice/snow buildup
What was that truck driver thinking?
You should get a 992 3RS
Yes yes yes yes Porsche to the collect yaaaaayyy I’d like to see a 991

992 GT3RS!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST SOUNDING CAR IN THE WORLD
Tbh I think once James gets his hands on a RS he’s gonna fall in love with them and possibly more than lambos
When you took that car from Florida to Utah a while back I passed you!  I still have the snap chat memory of passing ya on the highway!  Such a beautiful car!
Sell the cone🗣️🔥🔥
Video starts at 11:03  and ends at 11:15
"0:35 Okay I'm out then, the only thing I cared about was the countach"
Trade the countach and Espada for a Revuelto
Watching the video from my Fiat Uno 1992 - 44hp ..
Snitching for views is insane.
"Sell the egg, keep the house, marry Sophia and live a beautiful life."

The envelope is a check for an invoice for their wedding venue booking
Bro I love the egg but just sell it
The gas pump edit 🥴 ✨nostalgia ✨
Sell more merch. All YouTubers do it. Its more income
James and Mat Armstrong need to do a video
"James I’ve been here for 6 years following your journey, selling cars is a big part of your life and we, the fans can accept that, the Egg is lovely but it’s not worth selling the dream house, I’d rather you rotated between a few cars rather than having 20 cars 15 of which you don’t drive 🤷🏻"
you should get a gt2 rs
what you should get is a 2024 or 25 cadillac the v seres that will be cool or just a fast SUV
FEDRAAALL
Sell the egg

Don't sell the egg!!!!

"You know they have mailboxes at the airport, right?"
whoever installed that mailbox used hollow rebar? i always remembered it solid
"With semi trucks, they’re federally governed by the FMCSA. So technically that guy committed several felonies 😂"
WOOOHOOO HE IS SELLING THE EGG YEAHHHAHAHA
Well I guess it is air pollution but it's the s*** they're spraying into the air AKA chemtrails

Love Strad but he has no idea how those “split” bolts work😂

Marry sopia bro
991 on TOP
"I don't know much about the 991, so quite naturally, I'm casting my vote for the 992."
Why did everyone forget about his third channel called thidiots
winter is a bit of a stretch for you
"Strad the New Year Video from You we all hope to see is that you Sold the EGGG you are keeping the house and you are Marrying the incredible Sophia. Obviously everything on camera is always amazing but you two make a great team pal! 

Also i want to see your fathers truck finished! Im From Mass and love the video you made!"
"The latch in the door of the Aventador is probably stuck in the open position, as if you're pulling the handle. If it's not broken it may just need lubrication. As far as the mailbox goes those pieces are not bolts. Those pieces go down in the hole and the bolt screws down into them. They have threading on the inside and they also expand to hold everything in place"
"Go 991.2 turbo s no question, 991.2 has analog gauges 992 doesn’t. My dad had a 991.2 turbo S and it’s insane! You need"
you should get a gt2rs rather than 3rs. better car and pretty sure it’s less money

Everyone knows exactly where you live now.

"Got this off of Google:  ""Those who are convicted of destruction of federal property could spend up to three years in jail and be fined up to $250,000."""
Sell the egg
That company needs to know about that driver for sure. He doesn't need to be operating that truck.
"Its a federal crime not to sell the egg, keep the house, and marry sophia."
Marry her already.   So she doesn't have to go back and forth.
🤔is it just me or the tone of that Cadillac on cold start sounded a bt like the Agera V8?? just not as polished ofcourse...
"An accountant would say, keep the house as an increasing asset and sell the Koenigsegg…… you were an accountant? 🤭"
SELL THE EGG

Those sleeve type concrete anchors are garbage.
"""Fedrill"" 😂"
Please do not sell the egg 👍🏾
"Fiiiinalllyyy he is going back out on the road. Nothing against the house videos, but dude has not traveled much lately"
Those are not the bolts they're  the anchors that go into the concrete to screw the bolt into.
"Like this comment if you believe strad should keep the house, sell the egg and marry sophia. EVERYONE KNOWS IS STRAD AND WE WANT IT TO HAPPEN!!!!!"
I’m actually getting tired of the clickbait bro

"She makes James so happy, I genuinely hope their relationship thrives"
"Sell the agera HH for a CCX being the “cheaper” option, keep the house and finish up areas that need to be finished, marry Sophia, and maybe get a car alongside the CCX?"
My name in the title
"Sell the agera HH and get a “cheaper” hypercar being a Koenigsegg CCX  that way you can mod it in terms of putting an aftermarket exhaust on it and other stuff like that plus selling the agera HH for a CCX would free up cash to finish your house up in areas that need it and you’d still be a part of the ghost squadron. Also I’m pretty sure the CCX has a manual option as well so that would be cool having a manual Koenigsegg on the channel, and by “cheaper” I mean the CCX is $1.2 mil compared to the $3.5mil price tag of the agera HH."
Sofia is soooo fine. You are a lucky guy
Keep the egg bro
Countach is the blueprint for every Lambo that came after- Please! Mr Self Described Lambo Fan Boy- keep the Countach! No Lambo collection is complete without one!

"SELL THAT EGG!!! OR KOENIGG WHATEVER! SELL IT, THROW IT AWAY!"

There’s no egg content so might as well sell it
No one saying anything about how strad pronounces federal as fedrull 💀😂
Sell the egg!!!! It’s a no brainer!

0:14 those exist!?!?
"As a professional driver myself very unprofessional of him not to call and report the accident it is a federal crime for a hit and run but if he was using his phone at all during that he could face a 10,000 fine"
"James, with all due respect I’m failing to see the point of the two channels at this point. Love your videos on both channels, they’re equally high quality! 

Question is, why not just post more on the main channel?"
Wow. That driver wasn't watching anything at all. All those hits were 100% avoidable. Freaking super trucker.

"Bro sell the Koenigsegg and buy the new Lamborghini Reveulto

👇🏼"
You never have any good news do you
"Technically the mailbox is a federal crime, it is considered destruction of federal property, but the stop sign is municipal, so the Salt Lake City PD or wherever you live would have to investigate the stop sign issue, and yes, the USPS has mail police"
You are not wealthy enough to own the egg sell it.
"Sell the egg, keep the house and fi ish the house.  Buy some lower dollar cars and do some builds.  Cars the average person might have or be able to get some ideas for their own build."
"keep the house, keep the egg, sell the 812, murcielago, countach, etc. the egg it's so unique"
STRAD Great Video I'm so sorry to hear that a Semi Driver hit your Mailbox and I'm glad Sophia made it back safely and I can't wait to see some European content and I hope your 812 is coming along well

"what if you sell the egg, keep the house, and start collecting unique JDM cars. You'd have a crazy and beautiful car collection in that nice 30+ car garage house."
sell the egg
Strad is trying to cover his mistake by blaming the truck. 😂. He was probably driving it to see what being a trucker was like.
"strad..........please for the love of god just sell the egg


and marry sophia"
"Dang, makes me think twice about moving to Utah! I'll give you $250k and the dog goes with it."
A big block would be an awesome choice for your dads pickup. Imagine saying your dads pickup has a 10L motor. Make for great headlines and would be a unique choice compated to all the LS builds on youtube.
More reason to sell.... now you know what you need and can build a better place.
"Everyone saying sell the egg 😭 I get the view point, but James do what you think is best for you in the long run. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥"
Everyone saying sell the egg. At least he drives it. Sell the countach. Wasting money to drive it once a year? Lol that makes no sense
"Ya...as a postal employee, that's a federal offense to run over a mailbox. If it's intentional.  I don't think it was intentional. Someone should let the Post Office know though.  

As everyone else said....Sell egg, keep house, marry Sophia. Because if you don't I am gonna ask her out. 🤣🤣😛😛"
"11:54 Yes actually, USPS mailboxes are protected under federal law, trucker whom didn’t report it made things worse for themselves since they drove off"
SELL THE EGG MARRY SOPHIA KEEP THE HOUSEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those perfectly aligned skid marks in the road on the way out aren't you either ya right 😂😂

When’s the wedding?
The way you pronounce federal is kinda funny. Fedrool.
11:20 is the part we got clickbaited for 💀😂
Didn’t even realise it was the second channel until he said
“That’s bad.” As she waits for you to stop talking to dig into the Mac n cheese
"James, I’m Swedish and born near the Koenigsegg factory. Obviously my love for the egg is above any other car. But if selling it would bring us a lot of other awesome car content, I’m behind it. Also marry Sophia!"
GOD THIS GUYS IS 100% NUTZ
Merry Belated Christmas
NOOOOO. I don't know the lore but I don't care. DONT SELL THE COUNTACH. SELL IT TO ME. I HAVE 10 BUCKS
"Sell the egg, sell the house."
"I watched this , while my dentist, pulled a tooth. I ain't saying anything. Just telling the truth. No, she did not say ""you watch STRAD?"" I was offended. Hahaha"
I think you should get an financial advisor at this point😂
Keep the countach. Sell the egg.
Marrying my girlfriend and having a baby was the best thing I ever did in life. Just saying
Scotty Kilmer voice over?
Sell your regera
$10 take it or leave it.
"Absolutely sell the Egg. This house has been so long in the making, and it’s literally-in your words-your DREAM HOUSE. It seems silly to rid yourself of something you’ve poured so much heart and soul into only to keep one of 13 or so cars…
The car represents a joyful experience; the house, on the other hand-and even the girl, if that’s where you decide to take things-represents a life.
Think about it, man. We love you."
"That’s truck drivers info will not be hard find drive around look for the house with a bunch new pallets of stuff if anyone’s there asking if they havve the info of who delivered it
Looks like he’s a load Brick"
Its a federal crime what ive heard in my country
Buy tj hunt guard red GT3 with a GT3 RS engine and it is manual🤷🏻‍♂️
That Cadillac has been on the channel but not with the open down(up) pipes and top turbskis
Sell the egggg
Sell the egg.
Sell the EGG
Clickbait title again
The egg is a milestone. The bug was a milestone. You've made it dude. We all respect it. We'd all respect you selling it. For the channel there's not much you can do with it. Modify it and it loses value. Take more trips and get back to the shenanigans. Like skis and tracks on aventadors...
Sell the egg keep house and girl. Build an overland vehicle
"Your video always put a smile on my face even though i'm facing a really hard time now, i just got bankrupt, become homeless with no money what so ever and recently got left by my wife, but watching your video wether on your main channel or this one has always put me in Cheer.
Been watching your video since 2016, love to meet you someday when i already get back on my feet, love from your biggest fan in indonesia 😊"
"Strad saying he can't show us the footage because he's going to the airport. Ever hear about editing buddy? Obviously joking around, Strad is one of the best around, even if this video could be considered slight clickbait for audience adrenaline rush."
Is that not just a condensation temperature inversion from the lake?
Sell the egg already
Quit snitching on the semi 😂
"ur countach and espada are my fav cars in ur collection, but honestly im happy ur selling the countach since honestly an idiot like u shouldn’t drive it"
So strad needs a flamethrower
"Dude, even if you aren't likely to see this. It isn't worth reporting that truck driver for the damaging the property, because if they admitted to it then they wouldn't be sentenced to prison, but because they drove off they would likely be facing maybe 3-5 years plus a large fine. The dude was likely tired and just doing his job, it isn't going to affect you, you'll still get your 15% off coupons that you won't use in the mail."
"Sell the egg, get a pool done before summer"
Sell the egg
"I work for the USPS and deal directly with mailboxes getting destroyed.  Your box is defently owned and maintained by the post office.  Your letter carrier will alert management to the downed mailbox.  A couple of maintenance workers will come and secure the box back in the concrete.  The post office will not try to investigate who hit the box.  Frankly, it's not worth the time and effort."
Did the HOA pay for the roads or have the roads been turned over to the county. It is always better to push for the county to take over roads
I’m just starting the video please don’t tell me they hit the countach
I'm 16 and I'm looking at trying to save up for a 2010 audi rs5 coupe do you think it's worth saving for?
Imagine the Egg being Strad’s downfall when we all told him we didn’t care about it as much as him. “Not that our opinion is what makes him happy or gives him the energy to get up every day and make this channel what it is.”
"If you're selling the egg, please keep the Countach. We need a ""Lamborghini Collector Stradman""."
Sell the egg
"I think you should keep the countach for its future value. The car is very desired especially with that spec. Not only that, but now that the new countach is out, collectors are going to be wanting them more and more which means the price goes way up."
Those are not bolts. They are concrete anchors.
Sell
992 GT3TRS
Cement overlay for heat? Suction cup for dash cam? Some dealers may like to swap the Countach for the GT3 RS?
House is too big and expensive time to sale it

"Strad as much as you might like the egg, your life won’t be any different. Your content is only barely affected by the egg and with the money from the egg, you could do many new cool house renovations"
Yo please get a 992 gt3rs

Strad complaining about Salt Lake's air pollution after decatting dozens of cars.
"Hey, what ever happened to the two car build challenge between you and Soph? Did I miss the video. Haven’t seen any new updates on that?"
If I was your neighbor I would probably think it was one of your delivery trucks l o l
sell the egg
"Those are anchors and not bolts and that is how the anchors are, split in half."
Those weren't bolts silly! Those are plastic or cast aluminum sleeves that are put in concrete to give the bolt something to bite into. I.E instant threads.

Sell the egg
Sell the car. Keep the house. Do not ruin your future over some car. Cars don’t sustain families. Houses do
"Hey Strad,

It’s your money, your cars, your empire. Do whatever you want and we will support you along the way.

<3"
Why do people keep saying sell the egg
"11:58 yes, yes that is, destruction of federal property"
Call the Department of transportation
I didn't realize this was the second channel untill he said it :O
Next episode strad is fixing one of his cars
SELL THE EGG
Tampering with a mailbox is a federal crime
"Sell the egg, buy a 992 911 turbo s. Then pop the question to the wonderful person in your life so she doesnt have to spend time in canada so she isnt illegal lol."
Pretty sure the drives dispatch knows about the situation.
Come on bro...snitches get stitches...😁
Everyone saying marry Sophia. Yea as long as you set up your prenuptial agreement and make sure you are good on your end I agree completely. Also Strad you can easily put some weight on and get ripped don't feel bad about your chicken wings anyone can do it!!

Why not just sell it with Curated?
Go 992 Gen Turbo S. Modify it. (ESMOTOR)
what kinda tank tracks are those from? fiscer price?
"If you sell the house, you will always wonder what it could have been. We are fans of cars of all types, not having a hyper car doesn’t make any of your og fans not want to watch. I think sell whatever cars you need to finish the house, and then see if you still want to sell it! If you do, you will have a surplus of money to reinvest in your collection however you’d like. But the people want the Batmobile(Aventador) in the bat cave! At least finish the house and then sell it so you can see what the house can be when it’s finished"
"Hey strad, i think you should travel tge world doing car content"
The egg isn’t all that anymore. You have everything you’ve wanted and you have Sophia. Put that ring on her finger and just live life with her for a while and no more hyper. Least not yet….
Get the 991.2 GT3 RS
"not dissing just teasing but I think we found a new word that STRAD cant say correctly ""federal"""
"Egg sucks…. Boring and sounds like a gravel truck. 🛻

"Sell the house not your money makers, I watch for the cars not the house"
Yes mailbox is federal jurisdiction
I feel like we got WAY more Bugatti content then what we have gotten with the Agera so far :/ (<3 Koenigsegg)
Anyone else bothered by the piece of thread on his neck at 2:14
SELL THE EGG IT IS TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN
Keep the egg but if you sell it save the money for a veneno
Am I the only one that feels the Koenigsegg's arrival kind of torpedoed the Strad channel? I miss the pre-Egg era....
Stop selling the cool stuff and sell the egg
6 cylinders even with turbos sound meh.    Love Porsches but they’re sterile.
You should sell it on Cars & Bids!
Finally a Porsche 🥹
Porsche nut here. I’m super excited about some Pcars on the channel. Heys it’s still VAG!
"IF you get a gt3rs, get the 991.2. The 992 is too bubbly and lacks aggressive angles other than the rear (due to the wing). The 991.2 on the other hand is aggressive all round and a great car to modify IF you don't want to keep it stock."
"Keep the house, sell egg !!!"
Sell the egg and keep the house and finish it
sell the egg
Sell the egg
Sell the egg. Sad to say it but it needs to happen at this point
House is gonna be worth keeping long term. Cars come and go.
Start a car podcast!!!
He said that he would potentially sell the koenessegg
Sell the koenigsegg
"the pieces are the anchors for the bolts, not the bolts themselves"
Keep the house pay it off sell the egg lot of content from the bat cave and backyard
"If you must get a GT3RS out of any Porsche, at least go for the 991. 992 is so over done. In the last year, it has become like the 2017 MK4 supra. I mean it is a cool car... just over hyped"
No one seeing the bigger picture. Straf is learning from hoovie on the farm. We wants to live where I can make noise without pissing off hoa
"As a long time fan and why I own a Audi, tbh would be disappointing if you sold the house. Plus, life is about experiences and not all of them last forever, the egg was fun but who knows what the future may hold"
SELL THE EGG. SELL THE EGG. SELL THE EGG!!!!
hitting the mail box was technically a federal crime because it was technically tampering with the mail but it won’t be acted on as a federal crime because tampering with the mailbox wasn’t on purpose
"Sell the Egg, keep the house and the Canadian."
Sell Sophia keep the egg and move in with burlaka
Sell everything and keep the egg and Lambos… the modern day ones
"Love your channel, but it's all about featuring gas guzzlers, then you complain about the air quality. Hey, I'm straight-piping this and removing the cats. Ugh, look at the air quality! Get it together Utah!"
just sell the egg that house could make you way more money on the long run

"Sell the egg, the house is cooler"

I'M WAITING FOR STRAD TO GET A BRONCO RAPTOR ON 40'S & PORTAL AXLES 👀
Life going down hill
"Do NOT sell the Egg, if you think about investment wise, now the Murcielago is gone too, it’s the only investment worthy car in your collection, if you sell it now you won’t be able to get another one for that price again because of how the demand is going up for the Ageras. However it’s your car and your decision at the end of the day so if you sell it, imo you should get an another investment worthy car maybe a CGT or even a Huayra, considering the fact that Koenigseggs known for their unreliability, those options would be a lot better."
Did you pay less for the Lambo?
"keep the countach and the espada, sell the egg and keep the house"
Motorcycle guy is definitely at fault
5:56 Oh God. Lamborghini Aventador tracks swap pt 2.
Someone help me understand why he’s selling all these dream cars for a lease payment?
"The car has been on the channel but not with the top mounted turbos, I honestly thought he sold it 

PS on the main channel not this one"
"I love the content! If it’s absolutely necessary, sell the Koenigsegg too. You can store a racecar in a house but you can’t store a house in a racecar. You won’t lose your status as part of the Koenigsegg family if you do."
I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE GT3 RS THAN THE CADDY 
Thats not a bolt. It’s the outside housing of a concrete anchor. They are split so they expand when the anchor is screwed in to the concrete.
Sell the egg
992 gt3!
991 Porsche for sure
"Listen to the people that support and watch your videos, quit doing the opposite of what your supporters want it makes zero sense.."

Welp… I don’t care.
So rich and successful but just so very dumb

Sell the egg!!!!!!!!
He whipped out the Fedrual instead of federal.
No BS but it is illegal to hit a mailbox and run. If you let them know I'm sure they would not do anything. Like you said you and your neighbors can't get mail. I guess it might depend on state also
"11:40 yes they have USPIS United States Postal Investigative Service, and it's the longest serving investigative service agency in the united states history."
"SELL THE EGG, keep the house, MARRY SOPHIA, start a wonderful family!!!"

He is driving a Volvo Truck that I build in Virginia.
I mean you can live in your car but you cant make passionate love and have/raise a family in a car. Sell the Egg. Pay the house live sparingly. When snow hits make some snow. Content and sledding etc good honest fun make some money and marry that girl. If Canada becomes 51st state itll be dope
Content wise the Egg sucks. You've squeezed that towel dry already. Sell it!
It is indeed a federal crime to hit and run on a USPS mailbox. The more you know lol. The stop sign is a state offense
Sell the egg
"The United States Postal Service has their own investigative task force, messing with mail in pretty much any way is a felony and I'm pretty sure that includes messing with mailboxes. That dude is certainly gonna be found, he's gonna get fined out the ass, and almost certainly fired, maybe, who knows what he did about the fact he did it, he might get a heavy slap on the wrist if he was up front about it and tried to make it right."
Your neighbor bent the sign back using something called leverage
Probably an illegal immigrant driving the truck

Get the 992 trubo s and put a bigger trubo and tune the motor
"11:43 ""They must have a department like that, right?"" In case you actually are unaware, the USPS does have an investigative department, and you absolutely do not want to be on the wrong side of the USPS postal inspectors. I've read that the budget cuts has hurt the USPIS a decent amount, but they're still a group I would not want to piss off."
812 update?

The USPIS is the federal law enforcement arm of the United States Postal Service. It is basically the FBI for mail crimes.
"Yeah, sounds like it’s time to move"

That truck driver was having a day off ahah
Sell the EGG!!! Buy lots of fun “cheap cars” and FINISH THE HOUSE!!!
I drove a semi and have for the last 14 yrs. Yes it is a federal crime for the mail box and its destruction of city property in a commercial vehicle so that makes it a federal hit and run along with destruction of private property for running over the grass/ dirt areas. Not to mention leaving the scene of multiple crimes. Basicly if you can get the name of the company on the side of the truck they are screwed. Every truck has gps
Those were not BOLTS.....
"They're very few police departments you don't wanna mess with. The United States Postal Inspectors are one of them. You mess with the mail, they will come down on you like the IRS. It is a federal crime to hit and run a mailbox as it is federal property. The stop sign is also state property."
Not that is matters but what you said were split bolts were the inserts that were used for the bolts to mount into the concrete and really those should have been deeper.
Sell the egg bro. It's not worth it
Jay Leno is looking for an Espada!
Sell the egg and keep the house

"Sell the house, you don’t use most of it, only the garage"
"I spent a number of years installing traffic signals, freeway lighting, and overhead sign bridges. Nobody ever explained the why behind the what when it comes to grouting the bases. Thank you for the detailed explanation."
I think this was by accident but you just revealed your house location..
"dude those are concrete anchor sleeves, they are in 1/2 to start with."

992 gt2rs for sure but you need a tractor to tackle the house backyard project and put a little salt spreader on the back to mitigate your ice problem
"If you go for a GT3 RS, please go for a 997, it would make me soo happy"
"I'm not sure how u think things works but if u don't have the house with all the garages, u can't keep getting cars, let alone keep the cars u have now,  loose the house run the chance of loosing the girl a girl wants a home to call her own not a dumb car that cost just about what everything else cost, if u want to keep the car fire bomb some of the cars u have paid cash for keep the house and the car and restart the collection but shit I'm not the smartest  one in the class here"
Very good condition less the knob on the driver door panel  window crank....😂😂😂
"If the semi driver did not report the accident, it’s considered a hit and run. In some states you can lose your commercial license."
tbh i really feel like u should sell egg and live your life peaceful married and couple of cars that's what a og fan wants (no hate)
GT3 RS are you gonna track it then? Very stiff 😅
Don’t sell the egg. Take it to a track.
That ctsv is crazy
"On your driveway not melting, I feel this is the most hidden thing no one tells people moving to Colorado and Utah.  North facing driveways can keep snow in 70 degrees ignoring thermodynamics"

"Strad: The Government owns my mailbox!
Me: They own your house too. 😵"
Video about a car driving into stuff and a white Countach haha. Ring a bell anyone
Get a 997 RS with the manual
"Noooo, not a porsche, stay special, ever thought about a Donkervoort? Or KTM?"
"Thats a federal crime and you can I am sure send the video to them, Plus you got the license plate in the video, hopefully you can read it. You guys need to get an LPR in your area LOLOLOL"

"Get a 992 GT3 RS and twin turbo it, as the GT2 RS is no longer coming"
11:55 have I been saying federal wrong?
How can you have that much time and space to maneuver and still crash into thosw things? That person needs their license revoked.
Ik damon DDE has one and he seems to like it when pulling in his driveway
"Imagine this. You have several Lamborghinis, a koenigsegg bmw Supra 6x6 jeep a trx and you make content of a mail box… remember when he would go into the mountains with trax?"
"it would be nice to see james on the 2nd channel, not necessarily thestradman i think since id the 2nd channel could be worth a try"
I’m tired of all this negativity :(
WE NEED MORE STRAD AND SOPH CONTENT!!!!
"Dont ruin a dudes life for an accident. He'll lose his job and perhaps face many fines or jail time. Yes he did it and drove away, but he didnt hurt anybody, its just a mailbox..."
I would love to see a 2019 GT2 RS instead
Triple white Countach... front end damage... destroyed mailbox and stop sign? Someone is recreating Wolf of Wall Street.
Why not try selling on cars and bids?
USPS employee… 🫡

"12:15 Strad, remember that you have a 1st floor hall way and the hall way in the batcave that both lead from the garage to the house, you didn't need to go outside and risk slipping on the ice"

Dangerous neighborhood. Be safe out there 😅

The trucker driver is probably my friend who just started his truck driving career. Sorry abt him he’s still learning
"Those aren't broken bolts, Those are the anchors that the bolts screw into."
Would love to see you keep the Countach :(
Sell the egg 🥚

please please sell the egg. we love the house
Sell the gdamn egg
"A Porsche to the collection wold be awesome tho 👍
But since your selling some cars now to get monthly payment down, maybe try to finish the batcave first then add a new car to the collection 😉
Love the uploads and rip to the mail box 😢
Wish you, Sophia and good boi Oscar a good day "
I mean it’s pretty obvious who hit the mailbox and stop sign the guy in the triple white countach aka wolf of wall street countach. That’s why you’re repairing the paint/bodywork. Must’ve been on the ludes 😂
Perfect video 👌👌👌👌👌

Man I love the egg but pls it’s your dream house! Work on that! You can always work towards it some other time! We believe in you 💜
Sell the egg
Please sell the egg. I would rather watch you with 12-15 real good cars than like 8 and a 3 million dollar hyper car
"14:23 I think more importantly I wonder if the TRX is even gonna start, its been sitting there for like 6 months or so? When you go get the 812, bring a jump box just in case... I'm speaking from experience"
SELL THE EGG
😮
"I understand why you thinking of buying a porsche, but honestly, instead of spending so much money, please continue the buildoff of BMW vs Supra , James vs Sophia build off , would be amazing to watch"
"Yes, it's a federal crime to hit or destroy a mailbox"
Fegeral crime
The bolts are meant to snap so you don't die if you hit it
I love this car.  get why it's going.  ill miss it though
"sell the egg, no need for a multi million dollar car"
I'm surprised it wasn't a Mustang that took out the mailbox 😂
sell theeee eggggggg
Hate to see it go
Those aren’t bolts. They are lag shield lead anchors. They are meant to be split. When I bolt is driven into it they spread to hold in concrete. But what a douche. How is he just gonna drive away. also good click bait. I thought your car was hit.
"No, that is not mail fraud or anything mail related.  Your Post Office will try not to laugh when they refer you to your local law enforcement agency."
$35k a month
"Mailbox is a federal coke but the post office will replace it but good look finding him. As a ex employee of several years, they RARELY follow through"
Congratulations on the new house
"Hey, I don’t think it’s a sales pitch."
